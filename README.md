A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is going to contain most of the beautiful widgets and components from the flutter Animation app and the flutter plugin app.
Here is the list of the widgets that we are going to cover in this project.

From the flutter animations app:
Icon Animations : Responsive Icon 
Loop Animation : Ripple Animation
Button Animation : Progress Button 1
Animated List view 3
Other Animations: Expandable widget

from the flutter plugin app:
Plugins for cards: FlibCard Animation
Plugins for buttons: Like Button, Spring Button


After all this we will implement a custom widget that will use the hover of the mouse to display cool randomizing text with glow of the cursor.
